	    <h1>What we are about</h1>
	    <p><strong>Kiareys Wings & Grill</strong> goal is to bring top tier food to 
		the natives of the carolinas. We take pride in the quality and the variety of food we often. 
		Even though, we are a brand new resturant
		we feel as if we can complete with the best of them and 
		serve some pretty fine casual dining & take-out.</p>
		<p>We also planning to offer delivery all over the charlotte metropolitan area. 
		Possibility, in the near future adding a food truck on the weekend to cater to a wider audience. 
		Our Grand Opening will be on July 22, 2024 and we hope to have an amazing turn out. 
		Our business hours will be 11am-11pm on Tuesday through
		Thursday, 11am-1am on Friday-Saturday, and 11am-9am on Sundays.</p>
		<p> Contact us for any of your catering needs as well.</p>
